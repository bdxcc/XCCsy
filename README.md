##Use
Install and open the software directly
After version v1.3, all parameter descriptions will be prompted in the software's parameter settings. Simply move the mouse to the end of the parameter ❓ You can see the function of the parameters
After setting the options, select the image and click on 'Generate Print Frame' to output the image
###Rendering
**Horizontal image effect**
<img src="static/final effect. jpg" height="300"/>
**Vertical chart output**
<img src="static/final effect. png" height="300"/>
**Vertical to horizontal chart output**
<img src="static/final effect - vertical to horizontal. JPEG" height="300"/>
The above effects are just some of the effects that I personally use frequently. By combining various parameter options, more different effects can be achieved
##Custom Font
Click on the 'Font Options' button at the top (to the left of the' Restore Default 'button), and you will see a default font that comes with the software. There is a '+' button above the list, click to upload your own font file, which will only be stored in the user directory and does not involve internet connection.
